# python-commons

Shared infrastructure for Python projects — Makefile targets and AI agents for spec-driven, TDD development.

## What's included

- **`Makefile`** — linting, testing, and task workflow targets built on [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
- **`.claude/agents/`** — Claude Code agents
- **`templates/`** — templates for `CLAUDE.md`, Copilot instructions, and Copilot agents

## Adopting in a project

Run all commands from **your project's root**.

```bash
# Add (one-time)
git subtree add --prefix=.commons \
  https://github.com/CmdrPrompt/python-commons.git main --squash

# Include in your Makefile
echo 'include .commons/Makefile' >> Makefile

# Pull updates later
git subtree pull --prefix=.commons \
  https://github.com/CmdrPrompt/python-commons.git main --squash

# Contribute changes back
git subtree push --prefix=.commons \
  https://github.com/CmdrPrompt/python-commons.git main
# No push access? Push to a fork and open a PR against main instead.
```

## Governance files

`make install` generates `CLAUDE.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, and Copilot agents
automatically on first run using default values. To customise, run afterwards:

```bash
make generate-governance-files \
  PROJECT_NAME="your-project" \
  PROJECT_DESCRIPTION="Describe your project." \
  REQUIREMENTS_PATH="docs/REQUIREMENTS.md" \
  PROJECT_MAKE_TARGET="make web"
```

## Agents

Seven agents cover the full development workflow, available in both Claude Code and GitHub Copilot.

```
requirements-drafter → workflow-guardian → implementation-worker → pr-reviewer → merge
                               ↑
             bug-triage ───────┤
 characterization-test-writer ─┘
             dependency-auditor  (periodic / pre-release)
```

| Agent | When | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `requirements-drafter` | Before coding | Turns vague ideas into confirmed, testable requirements |
| `workflow-guardian` | Gate | Enforces task branches, TDD, and commit discipline |
| `implementation-worker` | Coding | Implements approved work, runs lint/test, commits |
| `pr-reviewer` | Before merge | Checks scope, tests, changelog, and acceptance criteria |
| `bug-triage` | On demand | Finds bugs without fixing — produces task files |
| `characterization-test-writer` | Before refactoring | Documents existing behavior with tests |
| `dependency-auditor` | Periodic | Audits for CVEs, outdated packages, license issues |

### Invoking agents

**Claude Code** — type `@agent-name` in chat, or describe your task and Claude suggests one automatically.

**GitHub Copilot (VS Code 1.101+)** — run `make generate-governance-files` first, then use the **dropdown** at the bottom of the Copilot Chat panel to select an agent.

## Conventions

- Tasks live in `docs/tasks/TASK-<NNN>-short-description.md`
- Every task runs on its own `task/<NNN>-short-description` branch
- Always commit via `make commit-current-task`, never `git commit` directly
