# Commit workflow

All git write operations in a python-butler governed repository go through
`make` targets. Never run `git commit`, `git add` (outside the worktree
auto-fix flow below), `git push --force`, or any destructive git command
directly. If a required target is missing from the Makefile, stop and report
it instead of falling back to raw git.

## Branch discipline

- Every task runs on its own branch named `task/<NNN>-short-description`,
  where NNN is the TASK-ID zero-padded to 3 digits.
- Create or switch with `make branch-task f=TASK-XXX`. Never work on `main`.
- If the task branch is behind `main`, run `make sync-main` before coding.
  An out-of-date branch is a blocking condition.

## Which path applies: check the branch name, not how you were told you were invoked

Before committing, run `git branch --show-current` and decide from the
actual name - do not rely on being told you're "in a worktree" or "on a
task branch," since that framing can be wrong or ambiguous:

- Branch matches `task/<NNN>-...` -> you are on a real task branch, even if
  the work happened inside a subagent. Use "Committing on a task branch"
  below.
- Branch does NOT match `task/<NNN>-...` (e.g. an `agent-<hash>` worktree
  branch) -> use "Committing from an isolated worktree" below.

## Committing on a task branch

1. Run `make stage-current-task` - it auto-fixes (ruff, format, pymarkdown)
   and stages the files listed in the task file, including `CHANGELOG.md`.
2. Run `make commit-current-task` - it commits using the message on the
   task file's `**Commit:**` line.
3. If the commit message needs to change, edit the `**Commit:**` line in the
   task file first, then run `make commit-current-task`. Never pass a message
   with `git commit -m`.

With an explicit task ID: `make stage-task f=TASK-XXX` and `make commit-task`.
PR and merge: `make pr-current-task`, then `make merge-current-task`
(squash-merge and pull main) when the PR is conflict-free.

## Committing from an isolated worktree

Subagents spawned with `isolation: "worktree"` work on a temporary branch
that does NOT match `task/<NNN>-...`, so `stage-current-task` and
`commit-current-task` are unavailable there. If `git branch --show-current`
shows a `task/<NNN>-...` name instead, you are not in this situation - use
"Committing on a task branch" above, even if you were told you might be
running in a worktree. Otherwise:

1. Run the auto-fix steps yourself: `ruff check --fix .`, `ruff format .`,
   and pymarkdown fix, then `git add` the changed files.
2. Commit with `make commit-output f="<changed files>" m="wip(TASK-XXX):
   <short summary>"`, substituting the real TASK-ID. This is the only commit
   path guaranteed to work from a worktree branch. The wip message does not
   need to match the task file's `**Commit:**` line.
3. An uncommitted worktree is torn down with no branch returned - the work is
   silently discarded and cannot be recovered. Commit before finishing.
4. If `make commit-output` is not defined in the Makefile, ask the Workflow
   Guardian to add it before committing.

## Merging a worktree branch (coordinator side)

When a worker subagent returns a worktree branch name:

1. Run `make merge-worktree b=<branch>` - this squashes the worker's
   commit(s) into staged changes via `git merge --squash`.
2. Run `make commit-current-task` to create the single real commit using the
   task file's actual commit message.
3. Once that commit succeeds, run `make worktree-clean b=<branch>` - this
   removes the now-unneeded worktree directory and deletes its temporary
   branch, so `.claude/worktrees/` doesn't accumulate abandoned worktrees
   across sessions. Keep this a separate step after the commit, never
   folded into `merge-worktree` itself - deleting the worktree/branch right
   after the squash, before the commit is confirmed, would destroy the only
   recovery path (the worker's original commit history) if the commit step
   then failed.
4. If no branch is returned, or `make merge-worktree` reports nothing to
   squash, the worker failed to commit - perform the work directly in the
   main conversation instead.

## Safety rules

- Never use destructive git commands (reset --hard, force push, clean)
  unless the user explicitly requests it.
- Do not revert or discard unrelated dirty changes.
- Keep every commit scoped to its task.
